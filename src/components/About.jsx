              I'm an aspiring software developer. I am a student in the Software Systems Developer Program at BCIT, which 
              has given me an opportunity to learn about the ins-and-outs of web development in many different tools and frameworks. 
              It has been fascinating to see how the functional and interactive websites we all use on a daily basis are created 
              behind the scenes.

              Before starting my programming journey, I completed a BSc from the University of Victoria in Microbiology, and I have 
              worked for government labs, biotechnology companies, and the University of British Columbia as a Research Technician.
